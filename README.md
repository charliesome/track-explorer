# track-explorer

track-explorer is a tool that uses data available on [1001 Tracklists](http://www.1001tracklists.com/) to recommend similar tracks.

It finds all tracklists that contain a given track, and then scores each track in those tracklists according to their distance in the tracklist from the input track.

### Usage

First, find the track you want to search for on 1001 Tracklists and copy the slug from the URL.

For instance, given the URL:

```
http://www.1001tracklists.com/track/81480_octane-dlr-break-murmur/index.html
```

The slug would be `81480_octane-dlr-break-murmur`.

Then pass that slug as a command line argument to `track-explorer.rb`:

```
Î» ./track-explorer.rb 81480_octane-dlr-break-murmur
  Inf  Octane & DLR & Break                      Murmur
  7.2  Metrik                                    Drift
  5.3  Noisia & The Upbeats                      Dustup
  4.1  Wilkinson                                 Automatic
  3.1  Calyx & TeeBee                            Elevate This Sound

```
